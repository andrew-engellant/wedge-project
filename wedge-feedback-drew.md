## Feedback 

Great work on this project, you can consider it complete. I'm going to read your files in order and give you feedback
as I move through them, from Task 1 to Task 3. 

I appreciated your reflections in the submission.md file. Those outcomes are pretty much exactly what I have in mind, so it's nice to see them landing. 

### Task 1

* Not too much to say on this. Very efficient implementation. I was mildly surprised to see a notebook! Nice job throughout these two files.  

### Task 2

* I appreciate that you took the time to do this with the reproducible approach. 
* Great work on this. Pretty much as efficient as it gets. 


### Task 3

* Nice job on this, very efficient. 
* Also, kudos for recalling (or re-deriving) the query we had in Intro to SQL. The sheer number of people who didn't put that together is ... surprising.
* Love those `to_sql` commands. So much easier than the old way we did this.
